# Spring Boot Rest API With Records Demo
In this short tutorial I cover the following:
* Using Records for DTOs
* Using Records pattern matching to deconstruct values 

To run the example use:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

It'll be running at http://localhost:8080/, use http://localhost:8080/employees to list employees and http://localhost:8080/departments
